Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is [Christine Adhiambo Onyango], and I am currently learning how to use Git and GitHub. I enjoy working with technology and improving my skills. I am excited to start my journey in software development and version control.

I look forward to learning more and using GitHub for future projects and collaboration.
